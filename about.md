Software developer with meticulous attention to detail, communication and a love for functional programming. I'm passionate about clean, maintainable and robust code.

As a developer, I enjoy working across disciplines to challenge the boundaries between technology and humanities. I firmly believe they both elevate each other, and it’s undeniable that understanding different perspectives is important to address common issues.

I’m an avid reader and hiking enthusiast.
